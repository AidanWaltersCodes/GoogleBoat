            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>The inspiration behind Google Boat is creating a similar map service for mobile users that Google Map provides, 
                but in the context of commercial boating. There are recent trends of boating increasing in popularity with 40% of boat 
                sales increasing during the Covid pandemic, and now 11.9% of U.S. households own a recreational boat. Because of the increase 
                in demand, Google wants to give users the ability to know where boats are in recreational waters, how to easily navigate with 
                your boat, and provide additional information that could be pertinent to all different types of boaters! With Google Boat users 
                will be able to see the current water traffic occurring nearby to make informed decisions on where they should go and what docks 
                they should use. Google boat, will use satellites to collect geospatial information to create water maps for users, determine weather patterns, 
                potential obstacles, etc. Overall, Google Boat will enhance boaters' experience by helping them decide where to take their boat and how to navigate 
                safely while on waters. </p>
            <p>
                This app is designed for both recreational boaters and fishermen. Some of the key features in this app include real-time 
                positioning, AI-assisted navigation, personalized boat management tools, and crowdsourced reporting of unsafe areas. The 
                application uses advanced technologies like GPS, real-time data processing, and AI.  Additionally, the app will run on a 
                modular microservice architecture with Kubernetes for high availability and scalability. Google Boat will enhance the boating 
                experience by providing users with useful information, optimized navigation routes, and promoting safety on the water. </p>

        <h1>Use Cases</h1>
        <div class="use-case">
            <h2>Use Case 1: Novice Fisherman</h2>
            <p>John is a 28-year-old fisher who recently purchased his first boat. John wants to explore new fishing spots but is unsure about the best locations and how to navigate them properly. John discovers Google Boat and finds that it will help him carry out his fishing goals while still being a beginner.  </p>
            <p>When John opens the app, he is greeted with a user-friendly interface that displays a map. He can easily search for popular fishing spots and view information about different things happening in the area (weather, boat traffic, etc.). The app also provides John with AI-assisted navigation, helping direct him to his chosen location while considering everything going on in the area.  </p>
            <p>While on the water, John is happy being able to see the app’s real-time updates on wind speed, wave heights, and tide information, helping him make informed decisions while being new to fishing. John can easily make his way to his chosen fishing spot while saving his information on how to get there, as well as how to get back.  </p>

        <div class="use-case">
            <h2>Use Case 2: Experienced Recreational Boater</h2>
            <p>Sarah is a 45-year-old teacher who has been enjoying recreational boating for many years. She owns a mid-sized motorboat and takes her family on many trips during weekend getaways. As someone who is experienced with boating, she is mainly concerned with planning efficient routes to save time and fuel costs. Sarah also wants to make sure that she gets reminders of when she needs to get maintenance checks on her boat so she can take care of her boat. </p>
            <p>Sarah also likes the app’s ability to display the location of other boats in the area. The crowdsourced information from the app helps her make choices about which areas to visit and when. When exploring new boating spots, Sarah uses the Google Boat search functionality to find popular places to check out.  </p>
            <h4>In both use cases, Google Boat proves to be a useful and easy-to-use solution, helping each user’s specific needs. By providing a range of features that help with safety, efficiency, and overall enjoyment. Google Boat establishes itself as a necessary tool for boaters and fishers of all skill levels. </h4>

            <h1>High Level Design</h1>
                <p>After reviewing the use cases and requirements, it was important to think about how the design of this project will work. It became clear that attempting to use a single architectural pattern across the system would not be beneficial, so we aimed to decompose the problem into more manageable pieces.  </p>
                <p>The first category encompasses real-time position tracking and vessel monitoring. This includes immediate processing and response times, handling constant streams of GPS data and position updates for multiple boats on the water. The systems need to track the user’s boat and maintain awareness of other boats in the area. This category requires event-driven architecture for the best performance.  </p>
                <p>The second category involves navigation and path optimization. This domain focuses on calculations for route planning, looking at different things such as weather, fuel efficiency, and personal boat specs. These components require computational resources but operate on a request response basis.  Navigation information will be cached to the user and saved on the application to ensure no loss of navigation if internet service is lost. </p>
                <p>The third category is mapping layer management and environmental data processing. This domain handles the integration and visualization of different data streams. The data streams this domain handles include depth information, weather conditions, and wave/tide data.  These components need to process and combine different data sources in real-time while keeping optimal system performance.  </p>
                <p>The fourth category focuses on personal boat management and user data. Boat specifications, maintenance schedules, and user preferences are what this domain focuses on. Data persistence and storage are important as well as periodic updates.  </p>
                <p>By breaking our problem down into these four categories, we determined that a microservice architecture running on Kubernetes will provide the necessary flexibility and scalability for our project. Additionally, this will allow each component to use appropriate architectures for its specific requirements. The high-level module view of our design is shown below in Figure X.  </p>
                <p>DIAGRAM </p>
                <p>We will structure the software system that implements these categories of requirements into four main modules, each encapsulated within the microservice architecture. The Real-Time Positioning Module handles continuous position tracking and vessel monitoring with an event-driven architecture.  Then, the Navigation Module will manage pathfinding with computational services. The Mapping Layers Module looks at and combines different environmental and geographical data. Finally, the Personal Boat Module handles everything needed for the user’s boat like maintenance and boat specs. All of these modules are managed and coordinated through Kubernetes. Having container orchestration will ensure high availability, and efficient resource utilization.  </p>
