            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>The inspiration behind Google Boat is creating a similar map service for mobile users that Google Map provides, 
                but in the context of commercial boating. There are recent trends of boating increasing in popularity with 40% of boat 
                sales increasing during the Covid pandemic, and now 11.9% of U.S. households own a recreational boat. Because of the increase 
                in demand, Google wants to give users the ability to know where boats are in recreational waters, how to easily navigate with 
                your boat, and provide additional information that could be pertinent to all different types of boaters! With Google Boat users 
                will be able to see the current water traffic occurring nearby to make informed decisions on where they should go and what docks 
                they should use. Google boat, will use satellites to collect geospatial information to create water maps for users, determine weather patterns, 
                potential obstacles, etc. Overall, Google Boat will enhance boaters' experience by helping them decide where to take their boat and how to navigate 
                safely while on waters. </p>
            <p>
                This app is designed for both recreational boaters and fishermen. Some of the key features in this app include real-time 
                positioning, AI-assisted navigation, personalized boat management tools, and crowdsourced reporting of unsafe areas. The 
                application uses advanced technologies like GPS, real-time data processing, and AI.  Additionally, the app will run on a 
                modular microservice architecture with Kubernetes for high availability and scalability. Google Boat will enhance the boating 
                experience by providing users with useful information, optimized navigation routes, and promoting safety on the water. </p>

The app also provides John with AI-assisted navigation, helping direct him to his chosen location while considering everything going on in the area.  </p>
            <p>While on the water, John is happy being able to see the app’s real-time updates on wind speed, wave heights, and tide information, helping him make informed decisions while being new to fishing. John can easily make his way to his chosen fishing spot while saving his information on how to get there, as well as how to get back.  </p>
